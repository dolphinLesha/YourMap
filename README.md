# YourMap
Android Project

This is project for Android on Java. I started it some weeks ago and worked on it for about 20 hours including learning language and Studio.
This could be app where users may mark places which they visisted or planing to visit. Also every mark consist of photos and info. The main feauture is to merge maps with other people (friends) to build map of memories and wishes.
